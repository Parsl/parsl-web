[Parsl 0.6.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parsl) version released with several new features including support for implicit data staging, FTP and HTTP staging, application monitoring,  as well as numerous bug fixes.

This release includes one improvement that is not backwards compatible:
class-based configuration. To update to the latest version of Parsl you will
need to update your configurations and change the way you load the
configuration. To help transition we have included both IPP and threads
configurations as part of the Parsl package as well as documented
configurations for many of the [most commonly used executors](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/configuring.html).
If you would like assistance transitioning to the new model please feel free
to reach out to us. Our aim in moving to this new model is to significantly
simplify configuration through a clean and self-descriptive model.

Please check out our [updated documentation](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/), [tutorials](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Parsl/parsl-tutorial/master),  or contact us on Slack or parsl@googlegroups.com if you have any questions.
