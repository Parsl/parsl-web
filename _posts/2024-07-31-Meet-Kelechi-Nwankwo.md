## About Kelechi
You can call me KC! I'm a 28-year-old Nigerian from the southeastern part of the country. I'm thrilled to join the Parsl community as an Outreachy intern and excited to share a bit about myself with all of you. I'm a firm believer in the power of open-source software and the incredible impact it can have on our world.

**Where are you from?**<br>
I shuttle between two vibrant Nigerian cities: Aba, a bustling commercial hub, and Ibadan, known for its distinctive brown roofs and hospitable residents. Growing up in these diverse environments has shaped my perspective and fostered my love for community.

**What's your background?**<br>
As a versatile self-taught graphic designer, I've honed my skills through platforms like Upwork. My diverse experiences range from teaching to writing documentation for digital products at a tech startup. I've also explored data analysis with Python through Datacamp, all of which have equipped me with a versatile skill set that I bring to my role at Parsl.

**Core Values: Empathy, Curiosity, and Authenticity**<br>
I strongly value the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Empathy allows us to build meaningful connections and provide support to those around us. It is the foundation of my desire to help and uplift others with similar experiences. Curiosity fuels my passion for learning and exploring new (and sometimes unrelated) ideas. I thrive on the excitement of discovery, whether it's delving into a new language or immersing myself in a fantasy novel. Lastly, authenticity is non-negotiable for me. I strive to stay true to myself and my values, fostering genuine connections and a sense of integrity in all my endeavors.

## Journey to Outreachy and Parsl

**What inspired you to get involved with Outreachy, Parsl, and open-source software?**<br>
I've always been drawn to open-source software, Inkscape, in particular, has been a game-changer for me, a testament to the power of collaborative, free software. The collaborative nature and accessibility of open-source tools inspired me to seek opportunities within this realm. When I learned about Outreachy, I was immediately intrigued. I followed the journey of an alumnus, and their experience resonated with my aspirations.

Feeling inspired, I joined Outreachy because it fosters growth, collaboration, and inclusivity. When the opportunity for internships arose, Parsl's "Increasing Access to Distributed Computing in Python: Improving Parsl‚Äôs Website and Documentation" project resonated with me, aligning perfectly with my aspirations.<br>

**What do you hope to gain from this internship?**<br>
Through this internship with Parsl, I aim to immerse myself in the open-source world, enhance my Python skills, and forge professional connections. I'm eager to contribute to Parsl's mission and make a meaningful impact. One of the things I look forward to the most is taking the first steps toward a career that aligns with my values while maintaining financial stability. It's a dream come true to be part of a community that shares my passion for open-source software and its potential to create positive change.

## Hobbies & Interests

**What do you like to do during your free time?**<br>
You'll find me indulging in various hobbies. I love playing games like Stardew Valley, getting lost in fantasy novels (Lord of the Rings is an absolute favorite!), writing stories, and watching movies.

**What is your favorite...**
<ul>
  <li>üç¥ <strong>Food/Cuisine</strong>: I'm also a foodie who adores rice and fish stew.</li>
  <li>üìô <strong>Book/Story</strong>: Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis.</li>
  <li>üéµ <strong>Music/Artist</strong>: My tastes vary, but I often find inspiration in epic instrumental pieces like "Victory" and "The Colonel" by Two Steps from Hell. I also enjoy "Jerusalema" by Master KG and Nomcebo</li>
</ul>

**What is something on your bucket list?**<br>
One item on my bucket list is to learn how to swim. I also dream of owning a piece of land, no matter how small, as a symbol of stability and connection to the earth.

**What are some fun facts about yourself?**<br>
I can be socially awkward around strangers, but I push through it with a smile. I'm a big pizza enthusiast and a Lord of the Rings superfan. I'm not ashamed to admit that I've shed a few tears over cartoons, either!
